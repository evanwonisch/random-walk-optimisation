# Random Walk Optimisation
 
This simple Neural Network tries to discriminate points in a plane.

It is a javascript implementation of a fully connected Neural Network.
It uses the Sigmoid activation Function.

A Gradient-free "Optimization" method is used:

1. One picks a random direction in the Parameter Space
2. One follows this direction as long the Error goes down
3. If the Error goes up again it starts at step 1
